        "[Exploratory Data Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis), often shortened to EDA, is a term that you'll hear quite a bit in the field of data science. EDA is the process of examining a dataset to find facts about the data and communicating those facts, often through visualizations.\n",

        "In order to explore the data and visualize it, some modifications might need to be made to the data along the way. This is often referred to as *data preprocessing*. Though data preprocessing is technically different from EDA, EDA often exposes problems with the data that need to be fixed in order to continue exploring. Because of this tight coupling, we'll clean the data as necessary to help understand the data.\n",
